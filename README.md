# Cheap-system-for-protecting-children-in-the-car

In this project we are going to solve the problem of child forgetfulness that very common in recent years and because there are solutions available in the market, we will bring a cheap solution to a problem that will be attractive and affordable for everyone.
In addition, a friendly app will open that will alert you in real time about car forgetting.

The project consists of an application that works on ANDROID and communicates with the Arduino microcontroller through HTTP requests.

• The main purpose of the project is to implement an inexpensive system that will enable monitoring of the child in the vehicle and enable interaction between the Erdogino computer and the user's smartphone-installed app.
• The app is configured once for the Arduino microcontroller. The settings are saved in the app so that next time an automatic connection will be made between the Arduino and the user smartphone.
• The app interface will be simple so that even those who have no knowledge in the computing world will be able to use the product.
• The app will need to be synchronized with the "Arduino" microcontroller in order to identify the forgotten child in real time, in addition to the microcontroller being synchronized with the motion sensors and getting real-time data.
